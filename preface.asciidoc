== Preface

I decided to start working on this book when I was doing a whole bunch
of different testing related tasks in Erlang for a few different
projects and I wanted to write down what I was learning to make sure I
understood it fully as well as to help everyone else learn.

=== Why are you writing on Github

Well first of all I don't have time to do a full book by myself. I
have written two whole books and will probably write more in the
future, but for now I needed a different kind of project to work
on. 

In addition I felt that having an open process would result in a
better book. I hope other people contribute sections to this book that
I would never have thought of and can improve what I am writing.

=== Who This Book is For

This book is designed for people who are starting to use Erlang or who
have been using it for a while and want to explore how to do different
forms of testing in Erlang.
