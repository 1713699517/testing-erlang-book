      When you first start building tests in [[EUnit]] they will in
      general go really fast. Running your entire test suite will take
      a fraction of a second and it will get run a lot. However as
      things progress more tests will be added and each one will cause
      the suite to take a little longer to run. At some point You will
      find that instead of taking 0.2 seconds to run your suite it
      will take long enough to annoy you. At this point you might
      think that hey why not run each test in its own process and have
      the whole thing take advantage of the fact that I have a big
      fast computer with lots of cores, here is how to do it.
