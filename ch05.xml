  <title>Stress Tests and Performance Tests</title>
  <para>
    Unit tests <xref linkend='eunit'/> are great in that they tell you
    if your code is working correctly. They are also nice in that
    a new team member can look at a result of a unit test run and know
    if the tests passed or failed.

  <para>
    Performance testing is a whole different thing. While Unit tests
    are binary in their results (pass or fail) a performance test is
    very much analog. If I tell you that a system can handle "5,000
    concurrent users with a mean response time of 145ms+/- 32ms on an
    Amazon EC2 Large Instance"<footnote><para>Completely made up
    numbers.</para></footnote> is that good or bad? It would be
    impossible to tell without a detailed understanding of the goals
    of the system. However understanding how a system will perform
    under load is an essential part of any system that will be
    deployed.
