== Let to some TDD together

So far this book has talked a lot about the mechanics of tests, how to
create them, how to run them and so on. With this chapter I want to do
something different and walk threw an example of how to use tests to
Test Driven Development.

To do any form of TDD we need a problem to solve in this case I am
going to build a function that will take the output of a http request
handler in yaws and apply support for ETags to it. 

The logic of this is pretty simple as we have three cases. 

1) The user has never visited our page before and does not send a
+If-None-Match+ header, then we return the content with an +ETag+
header.

2) The user has visited and sends an +If-None-Match+ that does not
match the current data, which results in the same result as #1.

3) The User has visited and the Etag matches in which case we send
back +{status, 304}+ to tell the client to use their cached data. 

To do this we need two files +etag.erl+ and +etag_test.erl+. For the
sake of this chapter we are going to version them as +etag_NN.erl+ and
+etag_NN_test.erl+ with each example getting a new value of NN.
