=== Installing PropER

Like Dialyzer, Proper is a product of the research group of Kostis Sagonis at 
Upsala University and NTUA. 

PropER is a testing framework that uses a model to create random inputs and make sure
that the results make sense. The idea is that a unit test may try a few possible inputs
with PropER you can make hundreds of tests that will hopefully expose any strange corner cases.

However there is an art of how to do this. 


=== Setting up basic tests

=== Using types to drive tests

=== Integration with Jenkins
