== Testing against a Model with QuickCheck

Unit tests give us a way to check code against a specific test case,
but it is limited by the creativity and patience of the programmer who
writes them. If the function takes a boolean a parameter then it is of
course possible to try both 'true' and 'false' and make sure that the
function returns the correct result.

However there are many cases where the possible input domain is more
complex. For example we may wish to determine that some operations are
communicative in nature. In this case we can establish the property
that +F(L) =F(L')+ where +L'+ is a list of the same elements as +L+
but in a different order.
