#Testing Erlang


This is "Testing Erlang" which is an experiment in collective
authoring of a book on how to do Testing in Erlang. I want to tap the
collective mind of the internet to make this book amazing and to cover
a wide range of topics.

This book is for now a work in progress and is at an early phase. The
end goal is that it will be published as a book/ebook by a major
publisher.

## Technical Details

This project is being written in AsciiDoc which is a pretty simple
format, you can find details here: http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/
we will then convert it to Docbook (XML).

## Style Guide


Each chapter should be its own file named <topic.txt> So unit tests
are *unit_tests.txt* There should also be a directory *unit_tests*
that contains source code, figured and so on for each chapter.

Indent code with spaces not tabs, make it easy to read. Make sure all
code is referenced in the text in some useful way.
